Hi, I'm Wenjia Jiang, currently a research assistant at AGI Lab, Westlake University, advised by Prof. Chi Zhang. I received my Bachelor‚Äôs degree in software engineering from the School of Software, Henan University of China.

I am applying to Ph.D programs this year (26 fall). My current research interests lie in large language models (LLMs), multimodal learning, and artificial intelligence. I am particularly interested in developing LLM-based agents.

# Current Research

**ACGs: Agents Can Generate SQL by Querying Trees Like Expert**

Designed a novel framework to enhance the accuracy of LLM-based agents in complex NL2SQL tasks for enterprise scenarios. Simulated human data scientists' database exploration via Monte Carlo search, leveraging the discovered structural information to guide SQL generation for challenging queries. Preliminary evaluation on benchmarks such as **Spider 2.0** shows promising results. (_üìù Under review at ICLR 2026_)

**Paper2Beamer**

Developed a system leveraging an LLM-based agent to convert academic papers into presentation slides. Investigated interactive slide modification with humans in the loop, drawing on concepts from **human-computer interaction** and **educational theory**. (_üìù Under review at CHI 2026_)
